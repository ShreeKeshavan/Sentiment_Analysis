# Sentiment Analysis

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using Python and various libraries. It aims to analyze and classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to set up a Jupyter notebook environment. We recommend using Google Colab for this purpose.

### Prerequisite

Make sure you have the following library installed:

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `seaborn` for data visualization
- `wordcloud` for generating word clouds
- `matplotlib` for creating plots
- `sklearn` for machine learning tasks

You can install this library using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn wordcloud matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Dataset

For this project, we'll be using a dataset of text data labeled with sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook provided in this repository using Google Colab.

2. Load the dataset using `pandas`:

3. Perform data exploration and visualization using `seaborn`, `wordcloud`, and `matplotlib`.

4. Preprocess the text data and prepare it for machine learning. You can use techniques like tokenization and feature extraction with `CountVectorizer`.

5. Split the dataset into a training and testing set:

6. Train a sentiment analysis model using a machine learning algorithm like Multinomial Naive Bayes from `sklearn`:

7. Evaluate the model using metrics like a confusion matrix:

8. Visualize the results, generate word clouds for different sentiment categories, and interpret the findings.

9. Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters to improve model performance.
